# Project 2: Results About Filters Including Tychonoff's Theorem

## Section One: ExerciseSheet

This file provides a formalisation of various results regarding filters. The first four
are those at the bottom of *Section12Filters.Sheet3* in the course repository. These use
the user defined definitions for the `atTop` and `cofinite` filters in that sheet.

The main results in this section are the following:
* `exercise_01_proof`
* `exercise_02_proof`
* `exercise_03_proof`
* `exercise_04_proof`


## Section Two: Ultrafilter Lemma + Tychonoff

After these I have formalised Tychonoff's Theorem along with some preliminary
results to help with the proof. This uses Lean's filters.  Tychonoff's Theorem
says that if each member of an arbitrary collection of topological spaces is
compact, then so is their product.

Tychonoff's theorem is in fact equivalent to the axiom of choice, and almost all
proofs use AC. Mine is no different and here it appears as the 'Ultrafilter Lemma'.
Although used implicitly in my proof (Lean's version is used), I have proven my own
version of the ultrafilter lemma for completness.

THe main results in this seciton are the following:
* `isAtomic_filter` - The lattice of filters is atomic
* `my_exists_le` - My implementation of the ultrafilter lemma
* `my_tychonoff`- Tychonoff's Theorem

/-- **From Sheet 3** The `atTop` filter on a LinearOrder is the
collection of all sets with `{x | M ‚â§ x}` as a subset for some `M`.
It is the generalisation the `‚Üí ‚àû` limit. -/
def atTop (L : Type) [LinearOrder L] (e : L) : Filter L where

    constructor
    ¬∑ exact ha y (le_of_max_le_left hy)
    ¬∑ exact hb y (le_of_max_le_right hy)

/-- **From Sheet 3** The `cofinite` filter is the collection
of sets with finite complement. -/
def cofinite (Œ± : Type) : Filter Œ± where
  sets := {S : Set Œ± | S·∂ú.Finite}
  univ_sets := by

  inter_sets := by
    intro P Q hP hQ
    dsimp at hP hQ ‚ä¢
    rw [compl_inter]
    exact Finite.union hP hQ

/-- **EX 01** The cofinite filter on a finite type `Œ±` is the entire power set `‚ä•`.
Since the ordering `f ‚â§ g ‚Üî g.sets ‚äÜ f.sets` forms a `CompleteLattice` on filters,
`‚ä•` is indeed the whole power set of `Œ±` since the power set of `Œ±` forms a filter,
and no filter can be "smaller" with respect to `‚â§`. -/
theorem exercise_01_proof (Œ± : Type) (h : Fintype Œ±) : cofinite Œ± = ‚ä• := by
/- Writing `f = g` for filters `f`, `g` is notation for `f.sets = g.sets`.
Both of which are sets of sets, so `ext` is the tactic to be used. -/
  ext X
  constructor <;>
  intro _
/- `‚ä•` is the power set of `Œ±`, so `X` is of course in it. -/
  ¬∑ triv
/- `h` is a proof that `Œ±` is finite. `toFinite` infers from this
that any subset must be finite also. Since `X·∂ú` is a subset, we get
the result.  -/
  ¬∑ exact toFinite X·∂ú

/-- **EX 02** The cofinite filter on `‚Ñï` is the `atTop` filter. -/
theorem exercise_02_proof : cofinite ‚Ñï = atTop ‚Ñï 0 := by
  ext X
  constructor <;>
  intro h
/- Sets in `‚Ñï` are finite if and only if they are bounded above. Hence, because
we know `X ‚àà cofinite ‚Ñï` we have that there is some upper bound `L` for `X·∂ú`. -/
  ¬∑ obtain ‚ü®L, hL‚ü© := finite_iff_bddAbove.mp h
/- We wish to show that `X` is in the `atTop` filter on `‚Ñï`. So we need
a number for which all numbers greater are in `X`. `L + 1` works because
`L` is an upper bound for `X·∂ú`. -/
    use L + 1
/- The rest of this half of the proof ammounts to showing that if `L + 1 ‚â§ y`
then we must have `y ‚àà X`, since `y` is not in `X·∂ú`. -/
    intro y hy
    by_contra h'
    specialize hL h'
    linarith
/- `h` says that `X` is in `atTop`. i.e there is an `L` such that `L ‚â§ y ‚Üí y ‚àà X`.
This can be deconstructed using `obtain`. -/
  ¬∑ obtain ‚ü®L, hL‚ü© := h
/- Sets of Naturals are finite if and only if they are bounded above, so
to show `X·∂ú` is finite (i.e `X ‚àà cofinite ‚Ñï`) it is enough to show it is
bounded. -/
    apply finite_iff_bddAbove.mpr
/- `BddAbove` is an "exists" statment, we have to provide an upper bound. `L`
is the correct choice. -/
    use L
    intro r hr
/- `r` must be less that `L` since `hL` says that if that were not the case,
we would have `r ‚àà X`. But `hr` says `r ‚àà X·∂ú`. -/
    by_contra hr'
    specialize hL r (by linarith)
    contradiction

/-
The next two exercises involved comming up with counterexamples, and involved using
a lot of `have` blocks. After one of Kevin's Lectures I understood that this was not
in good style. So for these two I thought I would try out a more "Mathlib-esque" style
and prove lots of small lemmas before providing the main proof.

variable [‚àÄ i, TopologicalSpace (œÄ i)] [TopologicalSpace X]

/- In a Lattice, there is a notion of 'Atomic' elements. These are elements
with no elements between it and `‚ä•`. A Lattice `IsAtomic` if every element
has an atom bellow it. `Filter X` forms a Lattice, and since we can show that
an `Atom` is infact an ultrafilter, it is enough to show `IsAtomic (Filter X)`.
After this, we can unfold this in the context of Filters, and this is what we
do in `MyExists_le`, giving the usual interpretation of the ultrafilter lemma. -/

-- Credit to Kevin for getting me to type the line:

#synth IsAtomic (Filter X)

-- which pointed me in the correct direction.

/-- The lattice of filters on `X` is Atomic. -/
instance isAtomic_filter : IsAtomic (Filter X) := by
/- The orderind on filters is counterintuetive, if `f ‚â§ g` then
this means that `g.sets ‚äÜ f.sets`. For this reason we need a version of
Zorn's lemma which works for finding a 'least element'. i.e an ultrafilters
are 'small' with respect to `‚â§`. -/
  apply IsAtomic.of_isChain_bounded
  intro c hc hne hcnbot
/- We want to provide a lower bound on the chain `c` which is not `‚ä•`.
`sInf c` is the union of all of the filters in `c` and is the correct choice. -/

for `c`. -/

/- Trivially, any element of `c` is greater than the infimum. -/
    exact sInf_le hU
  ¬∑ rw [‚Üê neBot_iff]
/- The `sInf` of a set is not equal to `‚ä•` if the set is nonempty, the
partial order `‚â§` is 'directed' on the set, and `‚ä•` is not in the set.
'directed' means that for any pair of elements in the set, we can find a third
`‚â•` both. If the set were not directed, then the `sInf` may well be `‚ä•`.
consider for instance the case where `c` is the collection of
all principal filters generated by points in `X`. Then the smallest filter
(w.r.t `‚â§`) 'less' than all of them is the power set of `X`. i.e `‚ä•`. -/
    refine sInf_neBot_of_directed' hne ?_ hcnbot
/- It turns out that chains do indeed have this directed property since for any
`x y` in a chain we have `x ‚â§ y` or `y ‚â§ x`. So the maximum of `x y` is bigger than both. -/
